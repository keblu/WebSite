# Biography

I am currently an SNSF Postdoctoral researcher, focusing on how the news media informed (or misinformed) financial markets. 
I hold a joint doctoral degree in Finance and Business Economics from the University of Neuchâtel and Vrije Universiteit Brussel, respectively. 
My current work is centered around the field of Sentometrics, which lies at the intersection of text analysis (NLP) and econometrics. 

My interests are centered on climate finance issues, financial machine learning (particularly regarding the use of text as data), volatility in financial markets, and alternative risk premia.
I am the author and co-author of several R packages, including the MSGARCH, NSE, the Sentometrics package, and the WordPower package, which is still in very early development. 

When I do not do research or side projects, I mostly read books from various genres, such as financial history, biography, psychology, health, and sci-fi.
