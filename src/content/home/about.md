# Biography

I am curently a SNSF Postdoctoral researcher, focusing on how the news media informed (or disinformed) financial markets. 
I am the holder of  a joint doctoral degree in Finance and Business Economics from the the University of Neuchâtel and Vrije Universiteit Brussel, respectively. 
My current work is particularly centered around the field of Sentometrics, which lies at the intersection of text analysis (NLP) and econometrics. 

I invested myself in computer programming from a young age. I now mainly focus on the R statistical language, and I am a proponent of open source software and reproducible research. 
I am the author and co-author several R packages including the MSGARCH, NSE, and the Sentometrics package, as welle as the the WordPower package, which is still in very early devloppement. 

When I am not doing research or side project, I indulge myself in books from a wide variety of genres such as financial history, biography, psychology, and sci-fi.
