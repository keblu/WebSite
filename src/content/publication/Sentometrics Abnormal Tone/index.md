abstract = "This paper investigates the abnormal tone dynamics of news media  articles about firms near earnings announcements and how it relates to earnings results and the stock market. We document a post--earnings abnormal tone drift, suggesting inertia in the media opinion. Also, we find that negative cumulative abnormal tone at the earnings events predicts a subsequent stock price reversal. Higher investor's attention, due to event coverage by the three type of sources (i.e., newswire, newspaper, web publication), amplifies the reversal. Finally, a high level of abnormal share turnover at those events suggests that the reversal is due to overreacting investors."
