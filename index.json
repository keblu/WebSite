    "summary": "Modern calculation of textual sentiment involves a myriad of choices for the actual calibration. We introduce a general sentiment engineering framework that optimizes the design for forecasting purposes. It includes the use of the elastic net for sparse data-driven selection and weighting of thousands of sentiment values. These values are obtained by pooling the textual sentiment values across publication venues, article topics, sentiment construction methods, and time. We apply the framework to investigate the added value of textual analysis-based sentiment indices for forecasting economic growth in the US. We find that, compared to the use of high-dimensional forecasting techniques based on only economic and financial indicators, the additional use of optimized news-based sentiment values yields significant accuracy gains in forecasting the nine-month and annual growth rates of the US industrial production.",

    "summary": "The advent of massive amounts of textual, auditive and visual data has spurred a new strand of econometric research which investigates the transformation of qualitative sentiment data into quantitative sentiment variables, and their subsequent application in an econometric analysis of the relationships between variables. We survey this emerging research field and refer to it as sentometrics, which is a composition of sentiment and econometrics. We provide an overview of the generic steps in a typical sentometrics analysis. For each of those steps, we summarize the relevant literature, discuss the available software, and point to some interesting research questions for future research.",

    "summary": "We perform a large-scale empirical study to compare the forecasting performance of single-regime and Markov-switching GARCH (MSGARCH) models from a risk management perspective. We find that, for daily, weekly, and ten-day equity log-returns, MSGARCH models yield more accurate Value-at-Risk, Expected Shortfall, and left-tail distribution forecasts than their single-regime counterpart. Also, our results indicate that accounting for parameter uncertainty improves left-tail predictions, independently of the inclusion of the Markov-switching mechanism.",

In our framework, we use text-mining techniques to derive the normal tone based on market and sector-wide news. We then focus on corporate events and track the abnormal tone dynamics around that event. This leads to a cumulative abnormal tone chart. We apply the CAT framework to the analysis of cumulative abnormal returns across earnings press releases. We find that the analysis of ﬁrm’s abnormal tone provides investors with relevant predictive information on the firm’s stock performance.",

Markov-switching GARCH models have become popular methods to account for regime changes in the conditional variance dynamics of time series. The package MSGARCH allows the user to perform simulations as well as Maximum Likelihood and MCMC/Bayesian estimations of a very large class of Markov-switching GARCH-type models. The package also provides methods to make single-step and multi-step ahead forecasts of the complete conditional density of the variable of interest. Risk management tools to estimate conditional volatility, Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall are also available. We illustrate the broad functionality of the MSGARCH package using exchange rate and stock market return data.",

Driven by data availability, sentiment analysis is increasingly used to capture the information value contained within textual data of all sorts and to relate it to quantitative variables. The sentometrics package allows to compute sentiment scores of numerous texts at once, to aggregate the scores into multiple time series, and to use these time series to predict any other variable.
