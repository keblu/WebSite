    "summary": "The modern calculation of textual sentiment involves a myriad of choices as to the actual calibration. We introduce a general sentiment engineering framework that optimizes the design for forecasting purposes. It includes the use of the elastic net for sparse data-driven selection and the weighting of thousands of sentiment values. These values are obtained by pooling the textual sentiment values across publication venues, article topics, sentiment construction methods, and time. We apply the framework to the investigation of the value added by textual analysis-based sentiment indices for forecasting economic growth in the US. We find that the additional use of optimized news-based sentiment values yields significant accuracy gains for forecasting the nine-month and annual growth rates of the US industrial production, compared to the use of high-dimensional forecasting techniques based on only economic and financial indicators.",

    "summary": "The advent of massive amounts of textual, audio and visual data has spurred the development of econometric methodology to transform qualitative sentiment data into quantitative sentiment variables, and to use those variables in an econometric analysis of the relationships between sentiment and other variables. We survey this emerging research field and refer to it as sentometrics, which is a composition of sentiment and econometrics. We provide an overview of the generic steps in a typical econometric analysis of sentiment from textual, audio and visual data. For each of those steps, we summarize the relevant methodological approaches, illustrate with empirical results, point to new methodological routes and still unanswered research questions, and discuss useful software.",

    "summary": "We perform a large-scale empirical study to compare the forecasting performance of single-regime and Markov-switching GARCH (MSGARCH) models from a risk management perspective. We find that, for daily, weekly, and ten-day equity log-returns, MSGARCH models yield more accurate Value-at-Risk, Expected Shortfall, and left-tail distribution forecasts than their single-regime counterpart. Also, our results indicate that accounting for parameter uncertainty improves left-tail predictions, independently of the inclusion of the Markov-switching mechanism.",

    "summary": "This paper investigates the abnormal tone dynamics of news media  articles about firms near earnings announcements and how it relates to earnings results and the stock market. We document a post--earnings abnormal tone drift, suggesting inertia in the media opinion. Also, we find that negative cumulative abnormal tone at the earnings events predicts a subsequent stock price reversal. Higher investor's attention, due to event coverage by the three type of sources (i.e., newswire, newspaper, web publication), amplifies the reversal. Finally, a high level of abnormal share turnover at those events suggests that the reversal is due to overreacting investors.",

Markov-switching GARCH models have become popular methods to account for regime changes in the conditional variance dynamics of time series. The package MSGARCH allows the user to perform simulations as well as Maximum Likelihood and MCMC/Bayesian estimations of a very large class of Markov-switching GARCH-type models. The package also provides methods to make single-step and multi-step ahead forecasts of the complete conditional density of the variable of interest. Risk management tools to estimate conditional volatility, Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall are also available. We illustrate the broad functionality of the MSGARCH package using exchange rate and stock market return data.",
