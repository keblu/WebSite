abstract = "We provide a hands-on introduction to optimized textual sentiment indexation using the R package sentometrics. Driven by data availability, sentiment analysis is increasingly used to capture the information value contained within textual data of all sorts and to relate it to quantitative variables. The sentometrics package allows to compute sentiment scores of numerous texts at once, to aggregate the scores into multiple time series, and to use these time series to predict any other variable. The workflow of the package is illustrated using a built-in corpus of texts from two major U.S. journals to forecast an index of economic policy uncertainty."
